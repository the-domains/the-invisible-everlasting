# What if I live to be 10,000 years old?

What if instead of dying at 81 years old, I live forever?

Forever is a long time that hurts my brain, so to make it more manageable, I'll think of living to 10,000 years. Or 100,000, or even a million. 

That's a very long time. I'm going to have a lot of scars if I keep riding my mountain bike the way I do.

And what if, my 81 years here on earth determined how I lived my 9,919 years? Shucks. I'd better be paying attention.

This is the [way I believe it is][0]. It's part of my core belief system I want to permeate my real life.

You may or may not agree with me. But supposing you did - 
> 
> What then?

All the things that I think are important for starters, are probably not that important in the grand scheme of things. Things like:

* Career - pouring all available energy into being [a successful and accomplished person][1].

* Toys - all the [cool stuff][2] I'd like to have which aren't bad in themselves but eventually lose their appeal.

* Money - getting it, keeping it and growing it.

* Reputation - making sure people see me in the best possible light and adore me.

_\*sigh\*_

So then, what are the things that do matter? The things that last forever? 

We already know what many of them are. The challenge isn't the knowing. The challenge is the believing and living out of that belief that these things really do matter.

Like love, forgiveness, family, friends, spiritual health and a dozen others. 

There's one thing they seem to share in common - they're not particularly tangible. The payback isn't always as immediate, if at all while on earth.

But hey, enough beating myself up over the tragedy of it all. Let's get to the good news.

The good news is the things of eternal value are immeasurably better. What's more, it's available to everyone who wants it. Everyone. I know so.

I'm a real rookie in understanding and experiencing this, but that's my competitive advantage right there. It means I can more readily identify with many others who are in the same place. It means I don't have to try and fail, I can rely and trust.

And that's what it comes down to. Remember [this guy][3]?

> I believe, help me my unbelief

There's something inherently unknowable and [non-negotiable about faith][4]. It's the ticket to the game. To appreciate The Invisble Everlasting, you're going to need some measure of faith. Even if it's just a willingness to believe. That's our starting place.
