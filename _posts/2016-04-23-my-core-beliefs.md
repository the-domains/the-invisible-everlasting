# My core beliefs

I'm a Christian, and specifically by that I mean: 

* I believe I have a Father in heaven, who desperately loves me as a son 

* I believe Jesus came to earth, fully man and fully God, and willingly died on the cross - in my place so I wouldn't have to 

* I believe the Holy Spirit is guides me and without me fully understanding how it works, I'm a new being 

* I believe the Bible is the word of God 

It's simultaneously incredibly difficult but quite easy to write these beliefs down. It is a non-exhaustive list, and there's a lot of nuance to be added but there it is, my list. 

It'll be harder for you to follow along if you don't share these beliefs. I'm specifically targeting people share these beliefs, and in particular - like me - struggle to truly live out of a place of deep convictions about these beliefs. Because they really should radically change us, and they do change people every day. I want to be one of them. Join me.
