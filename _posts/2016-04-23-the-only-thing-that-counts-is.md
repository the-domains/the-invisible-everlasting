# And the only thing that counts is?

The average life expectancy for someone like me is 81 years. 

That gives me 43 more years before the game's up. Here on earth at least.

So it's got me thinking:

What do I really believe happens when I die? 

What's most important between now and then?

How am I making the most of _now_, especially if there is something bigger and better after I die? 

I do believe there is something beyond death. I believe it in my head, but not always in my heart. And because of that, my life doesn't always line up with this belief.

So welcome, The Invisible Everlasting
